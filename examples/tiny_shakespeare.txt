First Citizen:
Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All:
Speak, speak.

First Citizen:
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All:
Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen:
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All:
We know't, we know't.

First Citizen:
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
Is't a verdict?

All:
No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen:
They shall not have our corn. We'll speed them on their way.
Tear down the benches! Pull down the banners! Down with the quoifs!
Away with Marcius!

All:
Away with him!

MENENIUS:
They give, and do hazard, for us.
But they have more good reasons
For their distrust, than we can show for ours.

COMINIUS:
Trust not the heart of that man,
Which, having heard the sentence of the law,
Disdains the execution.

MENENIUS:
I shall prevail, and make him answer to it.

CORIOLANUS:
The fire i' the flint
Shows not till it be struck;
Our gentle flame provokes him,
And makes him answer to his advantage.

SICINIUS:
I wonder whence he comes.

MENENIUS:
From the senators.

CORIOLANUS:
I am going to them.
